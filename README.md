# Learning C#

This is **not** a learning resource, tutorial collection, or educational material for others. This is my personal repository where I am **continuously learning C#** through hands-on practice.

## What's in this repo?

This is where I:
- Put my **notes** on C# concepts (OOP, access modifiers, properties, etc.)
- Do **exercises (exo)** to practice programming fundamentals
- Follow **small tutorials from Microsoft Learn** and other sources

The repository contains:

- **Exercises** (`allExercises/`, `newAllExo/`) - Programming exercises I'm working through to practice C# fundamentals
- **Tutorials** (`tutos/`) - Tutorial code I'm following, including small tutorials from Microsoft Learn
- **Notes** (`notes/`) - Personal notes I'm taking while learning C# concepts
- **OOP Examples** (`oop-csharp/`) - Object-oriented programming practice and examples

## Purpose

This repository serves as my personal workspace to:
- Continuously learn and improve my C# skills
- Track my ongoing progress
- Store exercises and solutions I'm working on
- Keep notes on concepts I'm learning
- Practice coding by following Microsoft Learn tutorials and other resources
- Practice version control with Git

This is an active, ongoing learning journey, not polished educational content.
