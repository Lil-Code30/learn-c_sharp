# Learning C#

This is **not** a learning resource, tutorial collection, or educational material for others. This is my personal repository where I'm learning C# programming through hands-on practice.

## What's in this repo?

This repository contains:

- **Exercises** (`allExercises/`, `newAllExo/`) - Programming exercises I'm working through to practice C# fundamentals
- **Tutorials** (`tutos/`) - Tutorial code I'm following along with to learn new concepts
- **Notes** (`notes/`) - Personal notes I'm taking while learning C# concepts (OOP, access modifiers, properties, etc.)
- **OOP Examples** (`oop-csharp/`) - Object-oriented programming practice and examples

## Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Track my progress as I learn C#
- Store exercises and solutions I'm working on
- Keep notes on important concepts
- Practice coding and version control

This is a work-in-progress learning journey, not polished educational content.
