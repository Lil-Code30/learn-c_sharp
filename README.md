## 🎯 Topics Covered

### Core C# Concepts
- Basic arithmetic operations and data types
- Control flow and loops
- User input and output
- Type conversion

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access control
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complexity through interfaces and abstract classes
- **Inheritance**: Code reuse and class hierarchies
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding

### C# Specific Topics
- Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, etc.)
- Properties and accessors (getters/setters)
- `const` vs `readonly`
- Class vs instance methods and attributes
- Primary constructors and records
- Visual diagrams for access modifiers

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later recommended)
- An IDE or text editor:
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extension
  - [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### Running the Projects

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd learn-c_sharp
   ```

2. **Run the basic exercises**
   ```bash
   cd allExercises
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Run the Bank System tutorial**
   ```bash
   cd tutos/BankSystem
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Build a solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet build allExercises.sln
   # or
   dotnet build BankSystem.sln
   ```

## 📖 Learning Path

If you're new to C#, we recommend following this learning path:

1. **Start with Basic Exercises** (`allExercises/`)
   - Complete exercises 1-13 to understand C# syntax and basic operations
   
2. **Study the Notes** (`notes/`)
   - Read `oop.md` for a comprehensive introduction to OOP
   - Review access modifiers and other C# specific concepts

3. **Practice OOP Concepts** (`oop-csharp/`)
   - Implement examples from the notes
   - Experiment with inheritance and polymorphism

4. **Build Real Projects** (`tutos/BankSystem/`)
   - Apply learned concepts in a practical project
   - Understand how different OOP principles work together

## 📝 Example Exercises

The repository includes hands-on exercises covering:

- **Exercise 1-2**: Hello World and basic arithmetic
- **Exercise 3-7**: Mathematical operations and user input
- **Exercise 8**: Multiplication tables
- **Exercise 9-10**: Averages and formulas
- **Exercise 11-13**: String formatting and pattern printing
